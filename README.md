# No-Creeper-Ghast-Explosions
Sets gamerule mobGriefing temporarily to ```false``` to prevent Creeper & Ghast Explosions. The Data Pack does this when a creeper is about to explode near a player or when a fireball is in the world.

Test it on servers, because it might not work on some servers, due to unknown reasons.
